     "Disproject is a package for GNU Emacs that implements Transient menus for
dispatching project-related commands on top of the @code{project.el} library.  It
aims to provide a more featureful version of the @code{project-switch-project}
command, which it is inspired by.  Those who are familiar with Projectile may also
find similarities to @code{projectile-commander}.")

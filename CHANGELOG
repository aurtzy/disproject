* Changelog

** Unreleased

*** Added

- Added new customizable command ~disproject-find-line~, providing ~multi-occur~
  for project buffers.
- Included fallback commands for creating new git projects when Magit is not
  available.
- Added new command ~disproject-dir-locals~ for opening ~dir-locals-file~, or
  the personal directory-locals file (=.dir-locals-2.el= by default) with a
  universal prefix argument.
- Added custom variable ~disproject-custom-allowed-suffixes~ for
  permanently-allowed custom suffixes.

*** Fixed

- Implemented custom-dispatch-only prompt for allowing a local
  ~disproject-custom-suffixes~ value in the menu to fix a few issues:
  - Emacs kindly remembers potentially-unsafe values marked as permanently safe
    across sessions, but in the case of ~disproject-custom-suffixes~ where it
    may be changed many times to many different values, it can cause the
    ~safe-local-variable-values~ variable to balloon very fast.
    ~disproject-custom-allowed-suffixes~ is now used instead, which only tracks
    currently used suffixes.  Options to e.g. "save N most recent
    configurations" may be added in the future.

    Users who have extensively customized this variable may want to consider
    =M-x customize= to prune the historical values from
    ~safe-local-variable-values~.
  - The method used to obtain local variables caused the "risky variables"
    prompt to not actually allow the user to reject applying variables; custom
    suffixes were always displayed even if the user answered "n".
  - ~disproject-custom-suffixes~ was not pretty-printed at all, so it could be
    difficult to properly verify the variable was safe.  There is /some/
    pretty-printing now.

*** Changed

- Shortened "Extended command" to "Extended cmd." to make the column narrower.
- Marked custom variable ~disproject-custom-suffixes~ as safe in order to defer
  the prompt and apply fix with ~disproject-custom-suffixes~.

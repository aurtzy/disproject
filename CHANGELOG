** Unreleased

** [[release-version:1.2.0][1.2.0]] - 2024-11-28

This update consists of mainly quality-of-life / UX changes.  Some changes to
key-binds have also been made, with deprecations and planned removal
time-frames.

*** Added

- Add ~run~ custom suffix command type for general shell commands that don't
  need features from ~compile~.

*** Changed

- Display selected-project header for relevant menus other than the main
  dispatch.
- Display warning to the user when a custom suffix command type is not
  recognized instead of silently doing nothing.
- Change "active projects" references to "open projects" since "active" can be
  somewhat ambiguous.  The latter term is also used by Projectile, so this
  should give some consistency for those who have used it.
  - The key-bind for remembering open projects is also changed from =r a= to
    =r o= (the former is deprecated, but still works as a hidden key-bind).
- Prefix all options (currently, just =--prefer-other-window=) with a comma.

  This will permit eventually showing the options section for all relevant
  menus, since it's not immediately clear to the user that they can in fact
  apply to other sub-prefixes; e.g. custom dispatch and magit commands dispatch.
  Making options available in other menus was not reasonable before as the
  commands would be in the same "namespace" as other commands, making it easy to
  cause key-bind conflicts (especially with custom dispatch, which reserves
  alphanumeric keys for custom suffixes).

*** Deprecated

- Deprecate symbols and key binds related to "active projects" in favor of their
  "open projects" alternatives.  Removal is set for /at least/ 1 month after
  this release.
- Deprecate non-comma-prefixed options.  Removal is set for /at least/ 1 month
  after this release.

*** Fixed

- Fix ~disproject-dispatch~ not being autoloaded as an interactive function.
- Fix case where ~disproject-custom-suffixes~ was not considered safe if
  Disproject hadn't been loaded yet.

** [[release-version:1.1.1][1.1.1]] - 2024-11-24

This is a fix for an unlikely, but still undesirable bug.

*** Fixed

- Fixed case where if a user tried to remember active projects when there were
  actually none open, the known-projects file could be overwritten with an
  invalid ~unset~ value (value of ~project--list~ when it's not initialized yet)
  that had to be manually removed e.g. by deleting the file.

** [[release-version:1.1.0][1.1.0]] - 2024-11-21

*** Added

- Added new customizable command ~disproject-find-line~, providing ~multi-occur~
  for project buffers.
- Included fallback commands for creating new git projects when Magit is not
  available.
- Added new command ~disproject-dir-locals~ for opening ~dir-locals-file~, or
  the personal directory-locals file (=.dir-locals-2.el= by default) with a
  universal prefix argument.
- Added custom variable ~disproject-custom-allowed-suffixes~ for
  permanently-allowed custom suffixes.

*** Fixed

- Implemented custom-dispatch-only prompt for allowing a local
  ~disproject-custom-suffixes~ value in the menu to fix a few issues:
  - Emacs kindly remembers potentially-unsafe values marked as permanently safe
    across sessions, but in the case of ~disproject-custom-suffixes~ where it
    may be changed many times to many different values, it can cause the
    ~safe-local-variable-values~ variable to balloon very fast.
    ~disproject-custom-allowed-suffixes~ is now used instead, which only tracks
    currently used suffixes.  Options to e.g. "save N most recent
    configurations" may be added in the future.

    Users who have extensively customized this variable may want to consider
    =M-x customize= to prune the historical values from
    ~safe-local-variable-values~.
  - The method used to obtain local variables caused the "risky variables"
    prompt to not actually allow the user to reject applying
    ~disproject-custom-suffixes~; custom suffixes were always displayed even if
    the user answered "n".
  - ~disproject-custom-suffixes~ was not pretty-printed at all, so it could be
    difficult to properly verify the variable was safe.  There is /some/
    pretty-printing now.

*** Changed

- Shortened "Extended command" to "Extended cmd." to make the column narrower.
- Marked custom variable ~disproject-custom-suffixes~ as safe in order to defer
  the prompt and apply fix with ~disproject-custom-suffixes~.

** [[release-version:1.0.0][1.0.0]] - 2024-11-17

v1 release.  This CHANGELOG file has been added, which will track changes in

* Disproject

Disproject is a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] package that implements [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]] menus for managing
and interacting with project files.  It aims to provide a featureful, yet
extensible interface from which users can intuitively dispatch commands on
projects.

Some of its notable features include:
- a main menu with access to many of the built-in project library's commands and
  other project-aware commands;
- auto-detection of current project as the default project to act on from the
  menu;
- options for switching to other projects from the menu in order to execute
  commands elsewhere;
- a menu for finding common "special" project files, like the dir-locals file;
- a menu for custom project-local suffix commands;
- and display-buffer override options, to control where commands should display
  buffers to.


An Info manual is included with this program under the name =disproject=, which
can also be viewed in the Org format at [[file:doc/disproject.org]].

This package was inspired by the ~project-switch-project~ command, from the
built-in project library.  Users may also draw similarities to the Projectile
library's ~projectile-commander~.

** Installation

[[https://stable.melpa.org/#/disproject][file:https://stable.melpa.org/packages/disproject-badge.svg]]
[[https://packages.guix.gnu.org/packages/emacs-disproject][https://packages.guix.gnu.org/packages/emacs-disproject/badges/latest-version.svg]]

*** MELPA

Disproject is available in [[https://melpa.org/#/disproject][MELPA]] and [[https://stable.melpa.org/#/disproject][MELPA Stable]].  See [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][Getting Started]]
instructions for using MELPA.

*** Guix

Disproject is also available as a [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] package.

The stable version can be found in the ~(gnu packages emacs-xyz)~ module under
the name ~emacs-disproject~.  It may be installed in the user profile like so:

#+begin_src sh
  guix install emacs-disproject
#+end_src

Alternatively, one may use the package definition in =./guix.scm= to install a
development version of Disproject from the repository.  For example, to install
in the user profile, run the following in this repository's root directory:

#+begin_src sh
  guix package --install-from-file=guix.scm
#+end_src

** Usage

# BEGIN Copied text from Getting Started section of manual.

Disproject is usable out of the box.  After it is loaded, the only command that
needs to be known is ~disproject-dispatch~, which opens a transient interface -
referred to as the "main menu" - with access to a collection of commands that
the user can choose from to execute on projects.

The following configuration is a suggested minimal setup that can be added to
the user's init file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package disproject
    ;; Replace `project-prefix-map' with `disproject-dispatch'.
    :bind ( :map ctl-x-map
            ("p" . disproject-dispatch)))
#+end_src

# END Copied text.

See [[file:doc/disproject.org][the manual]] for more information on using and configuring Disproject.

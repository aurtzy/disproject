;;; Commentary:

;; Disproject implements Transient menus for dispatching project-related
;; commands on top of the `project.el' library.  It aims to provide a more
;; featureful version of the `project-switch-project' command, which it is
;; inspired by.  Those who are familiar with Projectile may also find
;; similarities to `projectile-commander'.

This variable provides a way to declare per-project suffixes like
common compilation commands.  Usually, this is done through
the `dir-locals-file'.

The value should be a list of suffix or group specifications.
See Info node `(transient)Suffix Specifications' and Info
node `(transient)Group Specifications' for documentation on
respective syntax.

Any key sequence starting with alphanumeric characters or
dash (regexp \"[a-zA-Z0-9-]\") is reserved for the user.

For common types of commands like compilation or shell commands,
Disproject provides suffixes with built-in features like process
buffer naming/tracking that can be customized via keyword values
in suffix specifications.  These can be found in:
  `M-x shortdoc disproject-customizable-suffixes'
Alternatively, if more flexibility is needed, see
  `M-x shortdoc disproject-environment'
for functions that set up variables according to transient state.

Some examples of suffixes using some of the various methods
described are provided below.  Note that some examples may use
the `advice' or `advice*' slots, which is an experimental feature
in recent Transient versions.

  ((\"f\" \"Find a file from project\"
    (lambda () (interactive)
      (disproject-with-environment
        (call-interactively #\\='find-file))))
   (\"m\" \"Run make\" disproject-compile
    :cmd \"echo Running make...; make -k\"
    :buffer-id \"make\")
   (\"M\" \"Run make test\" disproject-compile
    :cmd \"echo Running tests...; make test\"
    :buffer-id \"make\")
   (\"S\" \"Start `shell' in project root\" project-shell
    :advice disproject-with-env-apply))

`disproject-custom-suffixes' initially used a custom syntax
provided by Disproject for defining custom suffixes.  This is
still supported, but is discouraged in favor of a solution that
is based on Transient syntax, and may be deprecated/removed at a
later date.  The old syntax is used for suffix specifications
when the `:command-type' keyword is present.  Group
specifications are not supported with this syntax; only the
shorthand may be used.

This variable is marked safe due to various reasons discussed in
`disproject-custom--suffixes-allowed?'.  Prompts are deferred to
the mentioned function for explicit permission by the user - this
may be unsafe if unconditionally evaluated."

This does not do anything as a standalone command.  It is
intended to be used in Transient prefixes, where this command may
be specified with a value for the \\='display-buffer-action
slot (of `disproject-display-buffer-action-suffix').  This
enables generating suffix commands that can set the
`display-buffer' overriding action to custom values.

Users may specify a description for the action by adding a
\\='description entry to the action alist.  If this is omitted,
the suffix description will be used instead.

An \\='inhibit-multiple-displays entry may also be specified,
which will affect the behavior of `display-buffer' in certain
cases.  See `disproject-with-env' for more information.

For example, a specification for a suffix command that sets the
override to \"prefer other window\" might look something like so:
  (\"o\" \"other window\" disproject-display-buffer-action-set
   :display-buffer-action (display-buffer-use-some-window

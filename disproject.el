;;; Commentary:

;; Disproject is a `transient.el' interface that provides integration with
;; `project.el' for managing and interacting with projects.  It is similar to
;; (and inspired by) the function `project-switch-project', but also attempts to
;; improve on its feature set in addition to the use of Transient.

(require 'pcase)

  "Commands for the `disproject-custom-dispatch' prefix.

The custom dispatch was initially designed for suites of
compilation commands, but it is flexible enough to be used for
any custom command designated for a particular project, like
starting servers or updates.

The value should be a list of transient-like specification
entries (KEY DESCRIPTION {PROPERTY VALUE} ...).

KEY is the key-bind that will be used in the Transient menu.  Key
sequences starting with alphanumeric characters (regexp
\"[a-zA-Z0-9]\") are reserved for the user.

DESCRIPTION is used as the Transient command description.

The following properties are required:

`:command' is an s-expression which is evaluated and used
depending on the command type `:command-type'.

`:command-type' is a symbol that specifies what to do with the
value of `:command'.  It can be any of the following keys:

  bare-call: the value is called as an interactive function from
  the current buffer.  This is the only command type that is not
  automatically run in the environment provided by
  `disproject-with-environment'.

  call: the value will be called as an interactive function.

  compile: the value of `:command' should be a string or an
  interactive function that returns a string that will be passed
  to `compile' as the shell command to run.

When using the \\='bare-call or \\='call command types, consider
using the variable `disproject-process-buffer-name' (available
when evaluating `:command') as the buffer name for processes to
enable tracking e.g. process state.

Some optional properties may be set as well:

`:identifier' is used as part of the buffer name, and should be
unique to the command.  It defaults to the result of applying
`disproject-process-buffer-name' to the value (or first word in
the description if not specified).  Users may choose to set the
same identifier for multiple commands to mark them as
incompatible (only one can run at a given time).  This relies on
commands like `compile' which notify the user that a buffer with
the same name already has a process running.

To illustrate usage of `disproject-custom-suffixes', for
example, the following may be used as a dir-locals.el value for
some project to add \"make -k\" and \"guile --help\" as compile
commands and some custom `find-file' call commands:

  ((\"m\" \"Make\"
    :command-type compile
    :command \"echo Running make...; make -k\"
    :identifier \"make\")
   (\"h\" \"Get help from a program (if it supports --help)\"
    :command-type compile
    :command (lambda (program)
               (interactive \"sProgram: \")
               (concat program \" --help\"))

    :command #\\='find-file)

               (interactive)
